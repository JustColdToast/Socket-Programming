# Socket-Programming
A small program I wrote to try to send an image between two computers using the python [socket](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) module.

In accordance with their names, each Python file is responsible for a different task.

I was only able to get this working by having ports open on both devices (sender and reciever), and this project has not been updated since 2019 or so.
